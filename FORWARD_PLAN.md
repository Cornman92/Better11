## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Development Standards

#### Code Quality
- **Type Hints**: All functions must have complete type annotations
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings for all public APIs
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging at appropriate levels
- **Error Handling**: Descriptive error messages, proper exception hierarchy
- **Tests**: Minimum 80% coverage, 100% for critical paths

#### Safety-First Development
Every system tool must:
1. Call `ensure_windows()` before operations
2. Create restore point before destructive changes
3. Backup registry before modifications
4. Prompt for user confirmation (unless forced)
5. Log all operations comprehensively
6. Handle errors gracefully

#### Testing Strategy
```python
# Unit Tests: Test individual functions in isolation
def test_list_startup_items():
    """Test startup item enumeration."""
    manager = StartupManager()
    items = manager.list_startup_items()
    assert isinstance(items, list)

# Integration Tests: Test component interactions
def test_install_with_code_signing():
    """Test installation with signature verification."""
    # Tests that code signing integrates with installer

# End-to-End Tests: Test complete workflows
def test_full_privacy_preset_application():
    """Test applying complete privacy preset."""
    # Tests entire workflow from user action to result
```

## 🚀 Optional: Technology Migration Path

### Long-Term Vision: Native Windows Stack

The project has a comprehensive migration plan to native Windows technologies:
- **PowerShell Modules**: Backend system operations
- **C# .NET 8**: Core business logic
- **WinUI 3**: Modern Windows 11 UI

**Timeline**: 6-8 months (separate track)  
**Status**: Planning phase, not started  
**Decision Point**: After v0.5.0 or v1.0

**Why Migrate?**
- Native Windows integration
- Better performance
- Modern UI (WinUI 3)
- Microsoft Store distribution
- Enterprise acceptance

**Why Not Migrate Yet?**
- Python codebase is working well
- Migration is complex and time-consuming
- Focus should be on delivering features
- Can migrate incrementally after v1.0

**Recommendation**: Complete Python-based roadmap through v1.0, then evaluate migration need.

## 📋 Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Code signing complexity | HIGH | MEDIUM | Start with PowerShell, fallback options |
| Windows Update API changes | MEDIUM | LOW | Multiple implementation approaches |
| Performance degradation | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Profile early, optimize incrementally |
| Breaking changes | HIGH | LOW | Comprehensive testing, staging |
| Security vulnerabilities | HIGH | LOW | Security review, community audit |

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Feature creep | HIGH | MEDIUM | Strict scope discipline |
| Testing takes longer | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Test incrementally, buffer time |
| Dependencies unavailable | LOW | LOW | Use stable, well-maintained packages |

## 💡 Decision Framework

### Should I...?

**Q: Start v0.3.0 implementation now?**  
✅ **YES** - Infrastructure is ready, plan is clear, time to execute.

**Q: Follow the hybrid approach exactly?**  
✅ **RECOMMENDED** - But adapt based on your team size and constraints.

**Q: Skip code signing to go faster?**  
❌ **NO** - It's critical for user trust and future features.

**Q: Implement features in different order?**  
⚠️ **MAYBE** - Startup Manager first is recommended, but you could adjust based on user feedback.

**Q: Add features not in the plan?**  
⚠️ **CAREFULLY** - Small improvements are fine, but avoid scope creep.

**Q: Start migration to C#/PowerShell now?**  
❌ **NO** - Complete Python roadmap first. Migration is optional and distant.

**Q: Skip to v0.4.0 features?**  
❌ **NO** - v0.3.0 builds critical foundation needed for later versions.
