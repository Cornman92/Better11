## 📋 Decision Matrix

### Should We Proceed?

#### ✅ YES, if you want to:
- Build a production-grade Windows toolkit
- Establish user trust through security
- Create foundation for long-term growth
- Deliver value incrementally over 12 weeks
- Build community and contributor base

#### ⚠️ CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES, if you:
- Need value in < 2 weeks (consider Quick Wins path)
- Have < 10 hours/week available (extend timeline)
- Want to validate concept first (build v0.2.5)
- Have major technical concerns (prototype first)

#### ❌ DON'T PROCEED, if you:
- Don't have 12 weeks available
- Lack Windows development environment
- Can't allocate developer time
- Have different strategic priorities
